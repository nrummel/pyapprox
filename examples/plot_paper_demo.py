End-to-End Model Analysis
=========================
This tutorial describes how to use each of the major model analyses in Pyapprox
following the exposition in [PYAPPROX2023]_.

First lets load all the necessary modules and set the random seeds for reproducibility.

#takes a callback which is evaluated each time the adaptive surrogate is refined.

#%%
#Note that typically optimal
#experimental design (OED) would be used before conducting Bayesian inference.
#However, because understanding of Bayesian inference is needed to understand
#Bayesian OED we reversed the order. OED is much more expensive than a single
#Bayesian calibration because it requires solving many calibration problems.
#So typically we do not solve the calibration problems in the OED procedure
#to the same degree of accuracy as a final calibration. The accuracy of the
#calibrations used by OED must only be sufficient to distinguish between designs.
#This accuracy is typically much lower than the accuracy required in
#estimates of uncertainty in the parameters or predictions needed for decision making tasks such as risk assessment.

#%%
#Here we will set up a related benchmark to the one we have been using,
#which can be used to demonstrate the forward propagation of uncertainty.
#This benchmark uses the steady state solution of the advection diffusion,
#obtained with a constant addition of a tracer into the domain at a single
#source model as initial condition. A pump at another locations is then activated
#to extract the tracer from the domain. The benchmark quantity of interest
#measures the change of the tracer concentration in a subomain.
#The benchmark provides models of varying cost
#and accuracy that use different discretizations of the spatial PDE mesh
#and number of time steps which can be used with multi-fideilty methods.
#To setup the benchmark use the following
fwd_benchmark = setup_benchmark(

#Here we will use Multi-fidelity statistical estimation to compute the
#mean value of the QoI to account for the uncertainty in the KLE cofficients.
